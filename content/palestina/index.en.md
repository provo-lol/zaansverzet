## About

Zaankanters for Palestine works together on actions for Palestine in the Zaan region.

Since 7 October 2023, the Israeli occupier in Palestine has brutally murdered more than 28,663 people (last updated: 15 February 2024).

**That is equivalent to killing 17.94% of all residents of Zaanstad.**

<!-- 159,806 inhabitants of Zaanstad on 31 January 2023 -->

The occupying forces have destroyed entire residential areas and have made agricultural land unusable.

This can't and shouldn't be allowed to continue. This can't and mustn't go unpunished. We say:

- Ceasefire now
- Boycott Israel
- End the occupation

People in the Zaan region stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine.

Ideas for actions are welcome. If you want to do something together at your school, at work, or in your neighbourhood, please contact us.

## Protection

Have you been harassed at school, at your workplace, or on the street because you stand up for Palestine? Please also contact us. Then we will see whether we can do something about this together.
