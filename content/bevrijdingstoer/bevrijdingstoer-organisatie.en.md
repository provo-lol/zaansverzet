## About

5 May is Liberation Day. That's when, in the Netherlands, we celebrate freedom.

But what is there to celebrate?

Israel is currently committing genocide in Gaza. With support from the Netherlands. The Netherlands contributes to the persecution, killing and starvation of innocent civilians.

This has got to stop. 

Stand up for the liberation of Palestine. Take part in the Liberation Tour 2024!

In the run-up to 5 May, distribute liberation posters and flyers in your own town, so that people can hang these up in solidarity with the Palestinian liberation.

No one is free until Palestine is free.
