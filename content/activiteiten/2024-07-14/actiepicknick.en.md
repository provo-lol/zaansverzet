![Flyer with information about the Zaan Antifascist Action Picnic on 14 July, at 2.00 pm in the Veldpark](/img/zaanse-actiepicknick_2024-07-14.jpeg)

**With a live gig by [Your Local Pirates](https://yourlocalpirates.noblogs.org/)!**

On Sunday 14 July at 2.00 pm there'll be the first Zaan Antifascist Action Picnic. As good an occasion as any for activists in the Zaan region and beyond to meet up, learn from one another, and just hang out and chat. With coffee, tea, stickers, vegan snacks, rugs, quiet corners, zines, a live gig by [Your Local Pirates](https://yourlocalpirates.noblogs.org/), nice people, plenty to chat about, and potentially even some good weather.

The picnic is held in the Veldpark in Zaandam, near the water next to the skate park at the Heijermansstraat. You'll be able to spot the site from its Palestinian and antifascist flags.

Are you travelling by public transport? The picnic location is at walking distance from Zaans Medisch Centrum, which can be reached with plenty of bus lines (details below).

Potluck style: bring along something to drink or snack if you can (preferably vegan)!
